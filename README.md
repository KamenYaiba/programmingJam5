## Programming Jam 5.0 Solutions
This repository contains my solutions problems from Programming Jam 5.0 competition held at PSU in 2019.

# Approach
The competition allowed solutions in **C++** and **Java** (later editions allowed **Python** instead of **C++**) but I opted to write the solutions here in **C**.

Notably, in many problems, I didn't write input parsers, assuming "clean" inputs instead. I believe input parsing shifts the focus of the problem a little bit, and to be quite honest, it is boring and time-consuming.
